        <p class="text-primary-Light-gray opacity-80 mt-6">‚Äú I was an EMT for
            many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
            here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
            I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
            grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
            startup. ‚Äù</p>

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who
          did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning
          from their experiences was easy.

        ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned
          about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me
          the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
          myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
          You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
          community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù

            ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
            code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
            of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
            entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
            and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
            particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
            way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it
            during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
            certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
